## Description 🟢

Hi everyone! In this project, a single-page web application is designed where users can add new products to their shopping lists, store these products on a mock API and update them in their shopping carts. A user-friendly interface is aimed using React, and transition between pages is provided using React Router. There is also a 'New Product' tab that allows manual data entry into the API used in the project.
